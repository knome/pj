usage:

    pj program-to-run --program args
    pj --stats program-to-run --program args
    pj --kill-on-signal program-to-run --program args
    pj --wait-on-signal --kill-on-signal program-to-run --program args

It runs a specified program, capturing all child processes
forked from the original, and when the original exits,
proceeds to kill all processes it spawned. This prevents
processes from escaping and accidentally daemonizing.

By default, pj passes common control signals to the process.
Optionally, pj will instead interpret these signals as a sign
to kill the process and all of its children.

By default, pj begins killing child processes as soon as the initial
child process exits. Optionally ( --wait-on-signal ), pj will wait
until it receives a signal to begin collecting the child processes.
